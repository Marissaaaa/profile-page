        <h2 style="color:blue;">Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Marissa Estrada, I am a 16 years old Junior in highschool. I am an artsy person who likes to draw, make things, and paint. This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid. I've always wanted to work in the animation industry. Whether that be actually animating or be a character/background designer. Disney has always been my first inspiration along with Pixar and Dreamworks. Movies such as the Lion King, How to train your dragon, and Howls moving castle have added to my love of creating. </p>

        <h2 style="color:blue;">My interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> My favorite color is Blue. Always has been always will be. </li>
            <li> Anime is amazing since coming into my life. A couple of my favorites are Sk8 the infinity, Demon Slayer, Haikyuu, Inuyasha and so many more!</li>
            <li> All music is welcome around me. Now my favorite band is BTS, they have been the light in my life when I didn't have anyone to go to. </li>

            <li> Videogames are awesome particularily Minecraft and Ark:Survival evolved. </li>

        <h2 style="color:blue;">Why should you hire me?</h2>
        <p> What a great question. A couple reasons are how I tend to be a very enthusiastic person. If a project is going wrong I stay as positive as I can and help to find a solution. If I make a mistake I take full responsibility of my actions making sure not to repeat them. I strive to be a 'Jack of all trades' with my art. Just so I'm prepared for anything that comes my way.</p>
