        <h2 class="h2"> About Me </h2>
        <p class="p"> Hello, my name is Marissa Estrada, I am a 17 year old Junior in highshool. I love to draw and anything else art related. I have been drawing since I was a kid being heavenly inspired by Disney. As I got older I got introduced to more companies like Pixar, Dreamworks, and Studio Ghibli. Movies such as The lion King, How to Train Your Dragon, and Howls Moving Castle have increased my love of creating. </p>

        <h2 class="h2"> Why you should hire me</h2>
        <p class="p"> An amazing question indeed. As for why you should hire me heres a couple reasons. I am a patient person esspeciallly when it comes to dealing with rude people. I try my best to stay positive when thingsgo wrong. If I make a mistake I take full responsibility and learn from it. I aspire to be a "Jack-of-all Trades" when it comes to my art. </p>
